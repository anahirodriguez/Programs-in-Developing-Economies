Scripts for work done in stata for a final research paper that analyzes the relationship between the sex of a parent and the likelihood that they know their last child's birthday information. This paper utilizes 1998 Nicaraguan NHS data and includes 3 regressions tables with control variables and an interaction term that looks at the realtinship between sex and radio usage. 
I include the final paper, code for cleaning the data, and code for the regression tables.
